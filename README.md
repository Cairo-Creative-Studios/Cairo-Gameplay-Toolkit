# Cairo Engine
A toolset for Unity that serves to simplify Game Development. It's heavily inspired by Playmaker, and aims to create an even easier approach to game development than even Playmaker offers, while striving to be as affordable as possible, and hopefully open up the doors for what can be made by smaller teams.

## Design Principles
- Instant Prototyping
- Object/Data Driven Development
- State Driven Game and Object Loops
- Single File, Simple Game Script.

## Features
- Modules that vastly abstract complex game mechanics to little lines of code
- One Stop Coding, means coding most if not all of your game in the Runtime file, made possible cleanly due to modules and the State Machine
- Artifical Intelligence at your fingertips, no need to worry about the complexities of AI development. Feed it information, and the ML Module will do the rest.
- A Behavior Machine that allows common gameplay behaviours to be added to Game Objects in a matter of seconds.
- Easy Field Binding for UI Elements and Prefabs lets you create functional User Interfaces with little to no code.
